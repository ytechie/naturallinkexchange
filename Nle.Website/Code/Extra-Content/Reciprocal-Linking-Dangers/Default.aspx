	<h1>The Value of One-Way Links </h1>
	<p>
		Many of the concepts that make a link natural were revealed in the <a href="#">Google Patent</a>.
		In addition, the following "unnatural" suspicions about how Google used links to
		determine the ranking of a given page have all but been confirmed. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			the anchor text of the link - it should vary from link to link
			(as if the person adding the link to their site made up the anchor text)
		</li>
		<li>
			links from fresh pages might be considered more important 
		</li>
		<li>
			the title of the page that the link is on
		</li>
		<li>
			the growth rate of links to your website - the faster links are
			added the more they look like search engine spam
		</li>
		<li>
			the age of any given link - older links have more credibility than newer links
		</li>
		<li>
			the growth rate of independent peer documents - in other words other pages on the same site
		</li>
		<li>
			new websites with a lot of links look very suspicious
		</li>
		<li>
			links coming from the same class "C" address look suspicious as well
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		It's a safe bet that other search engine companies use or will soon use similar
		data to determine the value of the links. There are other factors that while
		not in the Google patent are also strongly believed to impact search engine
		results; these include: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			the relevancy of other content on the page in proximity to the anchor text
		</li>
		<li>
			the type of page the link is found on - is it static HTML or is it generated
			as with some existing automated link exchange applications
		</li>
		<li>
			search engines consider sites with a lot of content more important than sites with less content
		</li>
		<li>
			one-way links - many sites with multiple one-way links faired well during the Florida update
		</li>
		<li>
			duplicate content - the first one found with the oldest content is considered the authority,
			others are pushed down in the rankings.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		Managing all these factors is a great deal of work especially since you have very
		little control over many of these factors (title of the links pages, updating the link's anchor
		text, etc). Natural Link Exchange helps you manage these factors in several ways.
