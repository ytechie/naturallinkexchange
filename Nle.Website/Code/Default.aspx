	<h3>Naturally More Valuable </h3>
	<p>
		Not only is Natural Link Exchange free. It  makes your
		links more valuable than other link exchange schemes. It does this in several ways. Most importantly, Natural Links
		are added gradually so as not to trip the spam filter of the search engines. Just read the
		<a href="Extra-Content/Google-Patent-Secrets/">Google Patent</a>, it's quite obvious that Google is tracking the
		history of the growth of your website's link popularity. This single feature alone places Natural Link Exchange
		in an entirely different class than the crowd of "spammy" automated link exchange schemes.
	</p>
	<a href="Screenshots/"><img src="ScreenShots/ControlPanel.jpg" class="floatLeft" /></a>
	<p>
		As Natural Link Exchange adds your text links to other sites, it allows you full control of the link text as well
		as the frequency of distribution of each link text. You control these and several other attributes about your links
		using the Natural Link Exchange control panel.  You heard it right:  you easily control both the anchor
		text and the distribution of this link text (how many times a given link text appears on another site) for  your
		links that are located on sites that you don't have access to.
	</p>
	<p>For example, if you were selling widgets you might vary your anchor text as follows</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Great Widgets 60%</li><li>Blue Widgets 30%</li><li>Hot Pink Widgets 10% </li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In addition  you can change your link text as your ranking goals change.</p>
	
	<hr class="sectionBreak" />
	
	<h3>&quot;So I can control the link text. So what? Why is this so important?&quot;</h3>
	<p>
		Varying you link text is incredibly important. The <a href="Extra-Content/Google-Patent-Secrets/">Google Patent</a>
		proves it. The search engines are trying to crack down on link spamming. They  are watching your link text very
		carefully. Specifically they are watching how frequently the same link text appears. So the ability to vary and
		change your link text is critical to obtaining high rankings for your keywords.
	</p>
	<p>Here's what the experts say about your link text:</p>
	<p class="floatCenter">
		<a href="Extra-Content/Google-Patent-Secrets/">Google</a> Developer Matt Cutts has this to say about identical link text...<br />
		&quot;Identical link text looks like (and 9 out of 10 times is) a sign of manipulation of our Google PageRank algorithm.&quot;
	</p>
	
	<p class="floatCenter">Brad Fallon of <a href="http://www.instantseoexpert.com" target="_blank">Stomping The Search Engines</a>
	and <a href="http://www.MyWeddingFavors.com" "_blank">MyWeddingFavors.com</a>
	&quot;Varying your anchor text is critical&quot;</p>
	
	<p class="floatCenter">
		Jason Potash Internet Marketing Guru and creator of <a href="http://www.ezineannouncer.com" target="_blank">eZineAnnouncer</a>
		and <a href="http://www.articleannouncer.com" target="_blank">ArticleAnnouncer</a> recently wrote: <br />
		&quot;Google now places huge emphasis on links. They want to see a slow, gradual number of incoming links to your websites.<br />
		<br />
		And not just ANY links either.<br />
		<br />
		These links need to be a variety of anchor text links. If all your anchor links are the same -- look out -- you could get de-listed
		or de-ranked in a heartbeat.&quot;
	</p>
	
	<p>As you can see varying your anchor text is extremely important. The bottom line is it has to look natural. Natural Link Exchange
		lets you control the link text, set targets to automatically vary the link text to target distributions you specify
		(e.g. 60%, 30% and 10% = 100%) and distributes the links gradually.  <strong>Automatically</strong>.<strong> For Free</strong>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Know a Plumber?</h3>
	<p>
		If you think about the natural world, people who work in the same fields often know about and refer customers to each other.
		A computer programmer probably knows several other computer programmers. They also know of people in other fields that might
		not be directly related. One of those same computer programmers might be able to recommend a plumber to one of his computer
		programmer friends. That's natural. This is how Natural Link Exchange creates links to other sites. For sites that are in the
		same category, reciprocal links are created. For sites that are not in the same category one-way links are created. Both links
		also are included in part of a paragraph or mini-article if you will which also provides relevancy for the link. These one-way links have the added
		benefit of eliminating the chance for duplicate content by making pages more random.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Content Is King </h3>
	<p>
		Many SEO experts believe that the search engines look at the text around your link text to determine if it's relevant and
		the <a href="Extra-Content/Google-Patent-Secrets/">Google Patent</a> indicates this as well. Some have even done tests and
		believe they have proven that Google looks 10 words before and after the link text to gauge the relevance of the link. Have
		you ever noticed that links inside of articles seem to have more weight than links on a standard &quot;resources&quot; page? 
		Natural Links Exchange capitalizes on some of these theories by allowing you to place your link text inside of your description text.
		This gives it context and provides significantly more value to the link.
	</p>
	<p>
		How about links whose link text matches or supports the title text of the page? If you don't know by now the
		<a href="Extra-Content/Glossary/#titletag">title tag</a> of a page is a significant SEO tool. You should set the title
		tag of your pages to what ever you want that page to be found for. In addition most SEO experts agree that the title tag
		of pages off your site that have links that point back to you goes along way in telling the search engines how relevant
		your link is. So Natural Link Exchange allows you to set the title tag of a page that will contain your link - not every
		time of course as it would be impossible but every so often your title tag is used again making that link more valuable
		as well as varying the pages out there.
	</p>
	<p>
		As it creates article pages on your site, it intersperses RSS content thereby automatically providing pages and pages
		of fresh and relevant content to your website. All this content makes your site larger and provides valuable and useful
		information to your visitors. Also the additional content makes your website more interesting to the search engines,
		increasing visits by their spiders and improving your authority on your subject - larger websites tend to rank better.
		The freshness of the RSS feed also makes the spiders thirsty to return again and again.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Bigfoot Was Here </h3>
	<p>
		Some automated link exchange programs leave a giant foot print for the spiders. When the spiders see it, they run back
		to tell the search engines that this site is trying to spam them. Natural Link Exchange provides all the benefits and features
		above  with no "footprint" so these pages have the same look and feel of the other pages on your website!
