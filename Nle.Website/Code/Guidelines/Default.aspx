	<h3>Link Text Guidelines</h3>
	<p>                 
		Remember that part of the benefit of Natural Link Exchange is to generate content as you generate
		links. Please keep this in mind when building your articllets they are just a portion of an entire
		article as they will be placed on pages  along with articles from other Natural Link Exchange network
		members. Articllets will be randomly reviewed for content by both human an automated robots; poorly
		rewritten or spammy articllets  will be suspended.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Use loud, gaudy or ostentatious characters like ! $ or * <strong>very sparingly</strong> if at all.
			Do not over emphysize your point with these characters. Keep your punctuation modest and reserved
			as you would expect of others.</li>
	  <li>Do not use upper case, even sparingly except in the case of appreviations.</li>
	  <li>Do not capitlize each word in the articllet - use only standard sentence style.</li>
   </ul>
