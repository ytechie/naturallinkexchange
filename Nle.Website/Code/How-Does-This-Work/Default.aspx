	<h1>How Does This Work?</h1>
	<p>
		Natural Link Exchange is an automated relevant link exchange network that allows you as a busy webmaster
		and business owner to focus your time in areas better spent. SEO concepts are integrated into the human
		edited site list and resulting link network again freeing you the webmaster from the painful and time-consuming
		task of gathering links.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's a basic overview of how a site would join Natural Link Exchange and what would happen over time.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A new member signs up their site.</li>
		<li>
			The Natural Link Exchanage administrator reviews and either approves or denies the site.
			See our <a href="../Guidelines/">Guidlines</a> for sites permitted and those not permitted.
		</li>
		<li>Upon receiving the approval email, you login to Natural Link Exchange</li>

			<a href="#">Natural Link Exchange template setup video (Coming soon!)</a> for a demo.
		</li>

			each with up to 200 words. See this <a href="#">Natural Link Exchange article setup video (Coming Soon!)</a> for a demo
		</li>
		<li>
			Upload and add a link to your home page or you site map. The Natural Link Exchange page must be linked from the home page.
