			</p>
		<h2>Affiliates in the United States</h2>
		<p>If you are an affiliate residing within the US, you must enter the proper 
			taxpayer identification number in your account. Employer Identification Number 
			(TIN/EIN) is required for business payees; Social Security Number (SSN) is 
			required for individual payees.</p>
		<h2>Payments Requests and Delivery.</h2>
		<p>Payments will be made upon your request up to twice per month. No automatic 
			payments will be made. Payments can be requested from the Natural Link Exchange 
			Control Panel. For a high level of security payments will be made by check only. All 
			payment requests are queued and checks are mailed on the 1st and the 15th of 
			each month. Payments must be requested no later than 3 days before the 1st or 
			the 15th. Checks for amounts greater than $1000 are sent by Federal Express if 
			possible.</p>
		<h2>Sales Registration</h2>
		<p>"Sales" of free sites are not registered until the referred free site has been fully configured to 
			accept and distribute links, also known as activated.</p>
		<p>Sales of paid subscriptions are registered as soon as the referred site signs 
		    up for payment but will not be paid until the site has been active for the entire month.</p>
		<p>Partial months do not count as sales.</p>
		<h2>Refunded sales.</h2>
		<p>In the event a customer dispute cannot be resolved we may be forced to refund 
			the sale. When a sale is refunded the customer receives a 100% refund. If the 
			sale was generated through an affiliate account, the affiliate account will be 
			debited for the amount that was earned on the sale. Affiliate sales for leads 
			or Free Natural Link Exchange accounts will never be debited back to affiliates 
			- in other words all affiliate commissions on free accounts are non-refundable and will never 
			be taken from you.</p>
		<h2>Affiliate Authentication</h2>
		<p>The affiliate (if any) we associate with any Natural Link Exchange sale is 
			determined by an automated customer tracking system. Any decision made by this 
			system is final, and not subject to petition or debate. Our tracking system is 
			based on a first in, 30 day cookie and while we have designed our tracking 
			system to be as fair and accurate as possible, we make no representation 
			regarding the ability of the system to track any specific customer, for any 
			specific length of time.</p>
		<h2>Return allowance.</h2>
		<p>We may deduct a small fraction from each check we issue in order to cover any 
			risk of future returns (refunds and revocations) of Natural Link Exchange 
			products and services. Our standard deduction is 10% but we reserve the right 
			to adjust it up to 100% at any time. Only specific products and services that 
			can be refunded will have this allowance associated with them. For example, 
			free accounts will not have a return allowance associated with them. This 
			allowance will eventually be credited back to your account after six pay 
			periods (about 90 days).</p>
		<h2>Dormant accounts.</h2>
		<p>Accounts are considered dormant when there is a positive balance but no 
			earnings for more than 90 days. A charge of $1 will be applied on each pay 
			period (twice monthly) on dormant accounts. An additional $10 charge will be 
			applied to accounts dormant for 365 days. </p>
		<h2>Account closure.</h2>
		<p>You may close your account at any time. Closing balances under $10 will be 
			forfeited to Natural Link Exchange.</p>
		<h2>Account transfer.</h2>
		<p>Accounts can be transferred between affiliates but it is a manual process. Please contact 
			customer support for this activity. Access to the original email account will 
			be required to perform this transfer.</p>
		<h2>Postal delays & Reissued checks.</h2>
		<p>Should your check not arrive within 90 days, you may request another payment. 
			Just contact customer support. Please keep in mind that to issue a new check we 
			have to pay a check recall service fee to our bank therefore a $20 cancellation 
			fee will be charged to you. New checks will only be issued on standard pay 
			periods.</p>
		<h2>Payment Check Expiration</h2>
		<p>Natural Link Exchange checks are only valid for 90 days from the date of issue 
			and are considered VOID after that. Therefore you must deposit checks you 
			receive from us promptly in to your own account. Checks presented to your 
			financial institution after the 90 days may be refused. In order to issue a new 
			check, we must have physically have possession of the expired check. Contact 
			customer service to handle this issue and send you a check most likely on the 
			next scheduled payment period. We must charge a $20 for processing expired 
			checks.</p>
		<h2>Fraudulent checks</h2>
		<p>If a check from Natural Link Exchange is fraudulently endorsed and cashed by 
			someone other than you, please contact customer support and we will put you in 
			touch with our bank to open a fraud case. Once the bank determines that fraud 
			did indeed occur and after they credit the funds back to us, we will issue a 
			check to you on a regularly scheduled payment period.</p>
