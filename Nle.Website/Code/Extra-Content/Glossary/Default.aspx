            The number of web pages which link to a particular web page. The major search engines
            use link popularity as a factor in determining the search engine ranking of a web
            page.

        <dt>Link Text </dt>
        <dd>
            Text of the link on one page that points to another webpage. The link text is a
            very important indicator to the search engines as to what the page that is linked
            to is about. For example, search on &quot;click here&quot; in Google and you will
            find the first entry is Adobe Acrobat Reader because so many sites on the Internet
            use that anchor text to point to that page.

            This text is used as the name of the window when a browser is pointed at a page.
            It should indicate what the page is about. It should not contain the words &quot;Welcome&quot;
            or the company name unless that is what you wish to be found for on the search engines.
